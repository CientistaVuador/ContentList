Content List 1.1

This program is designed to generate a csv containing general information
about files and directories, which can then be used as a "ghost" file system
for searching files or for validation.

Currently, the following data per file is stored:
path - The path of the file, relative to input parent directory (unix style: /a/b/c/file.tar.gz).
type - The type of the file (FILE, DIRECTORY, SYMBOLIC_LINK, UNKNOWN)
created - Timestamp of when the file was created
modified - Timestamp of when the file was modified
size - Size of the file (or sum of children sizes if a directory, or 0 for others)
files - Total amount of files inside a directory (0 for non directories)
directories - Total amount of directories inside a directory (0 for non directories)
sha256 - A SHA256 hash of the file (empty for non regular files)
sample - The first 32 bytes of the file or equal to file size if file size < 32 (empty for non regular files)
